To run this proxy:
    - Go to settings in your browser and search for proxy.
    - Switch from "No proxy" to "Manual proxy configuration".
    - In the "HTTP Proxy" field, type "127.0.0.1", and in the "Port" field, type 8001.
    - Save changes
    - In the terminal run the proxy by typing "python3 server.py".
    - Go to the test sites and open them.
This proxy works with any HTTP site.
If the site includes the words "Smiley" or "Stockholm", they will be replaced with "Trolly" and "Link√∂ping".

If you have followed all the steps in the guide above but still don't see any modifications, the site might be cached.
If the site is cached, the proxy won't make modifications because the data is saved from an earlier visit and therefore wont pass through the proxy.

Most of the work on this proxy has been done from home, therefore most testing has also been done at home.
However, we have made sure that the proxy works at school as well.
We have used a lot of prints and wireshark to analyze what the requests, responses, and packets contain.

Because of our regex patterns, we will only replace words if there is a whitespace directly before them or if the word is at the start of the line.
So, if the word "Smiley" or "Stockholm" is inside another word, it won't be replaced.
